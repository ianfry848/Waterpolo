# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## maing a site for College coaches
so that I might have a better chance of being recruited. if you are able, and want to help
me make a seemless good looking site, I woud love that!

## honestly im new 
to this and find it hard to learn these coding languages without a proper teacher or youtube video.
help with anything would be amazing!

since I'm relativly new to the website thing (i know java) and git hub, I might think something is good but then revert it later beasue it isn't what I was planning on.

other wise all help is welcome, but I might need a slightly more detailed desription of whats happeing

##need help with:
1. I understand the the readme.md isn't where the code should go but I want to have the nice theme so if anyone knows how ot get the theme to go to the index.html file

2. I own a domain, however It currently forwards you to the github pages like in the top search bar. I could use help getting that the domain name to be what is seen in the status bar (I was told by Git Hub that i need to do womething with dns)
Also Im using google domains for the domain name
